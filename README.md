# About

Desolver is an optimized solution for writing resolvers in GraphQL. Leveraging promises, private and public functions, Desolver forms a wrapper around the resolver queries eliminating the template or boilerplate code needed. A pipeline (or array) of resolvers are executed with error handling within each query/request. Desolver even has an 'escape hatch' that permits ending the pipeline at your query needs or conditional requirements.

## Features
